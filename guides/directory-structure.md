# Directory Structure

A generated Amber app has a number of auto-generated files and folders that make up the structure of an Amber application.

When you use the `amber new` command to create your application, it creates the entire directory structure for the application, because of this Amber knows where to find the files it needs within this structure, so you don't have to provide additional input.

| config/ | Contains configuration code for initializers, environments, routing, and deployment |
| db/ | Contains database seeds and migrations. |
| lib/ | Contains local installation of all dependent shards |
